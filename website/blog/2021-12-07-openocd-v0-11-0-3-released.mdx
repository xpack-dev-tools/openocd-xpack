## Install

The full details of installing the **xPack OpenOCD** on various platforms

## Compliance

The **xPack OpenOCD** generally follows the official
[OpenOCD](https://openocd.org) releases.

The current version is based on:

TODO: update commit id and date.

- OpenOCD version 0.11.0, the development commit
[7ed7eba](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/openocd/commit/7ed7eba33140d8745f3343be7752bf2b0aafb6d8)
from Dec. 4th, 2021.

## Changes

There are no functional changes.

Compared to the upstream, the following changes were applied:

- a configure option was added to configure branding (`--enable-branding`)
- the `src/openocd.c` file was edited to display the branding string
- the `contrib/60-openocd.rules` file was simplified to avoid protection
  related issues.

## Documentation

The original documentation is available in the `share/doc` folder.

## Build

The binaries for all supported platforms
(Windows, macOS and GNU/Linux) were built using the
[xPack Build Box (XBB)](https://xpack.github.io/xbb/), a set
of build environments based on slightly older distributions, that should be
compatible with most recent systems.

The scripts used to build this distribution are in:

- `distro-info/scripts`

For the prerequisites and more details on the build procedure, please see the
[README-MAINTAINER](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/openocd-xpack/blob/xpack/README-MAINTAINER.md) page.

## CI tests

Before publishing, a set of simple tests were performed on an exhaustive
set of platforms. The results are available from:

- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/openocd-xpack/actions/)
- [Travis CI](https://app.travis-ci.com/github/xpack-dev-tools/openocd-xpack/builds/)

## Tests

The binaries were testes on Windows 11 Pro, Intel Ubuntu 22
LTS and macOS 14.5.

Install the package with xpm.

The simple test, consists in starting the binaries
only to identify the STM32F4DISCOVERY board.

<CodeBlock language="sh"> {
`~/Library/xPacks/@xpack-dev-tools/openocd/${ frontMatter.version }.${ frontMatter.npm_subversion }/.content/bin/openocd -f board/stm32f4discovery.cfg`
} </CodeBlock>

A more complex test consist in programming and debugging a simple blinky
application on the STM32F4DISCOVERY board. The binaries were
those generated by the
[simple Eclipse projects](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack/tree/xpack/tests/eclipse)
available in the **xPack GNU Arm Embedded GCC** project.

## Deprecation notices

### 32-bit support

Support for 32-bit Intel Linux and Intel Windows will most probably
be dropped in 2022. Support for 32-bit Arm Linux will be preserved
for a while, due to the large user base of 32-bit Raspberry Pi systems.

### Linux minimum requirements

Support for RedHat 7 will most probably be dropped in 2022, and the
minimum requirement will be raised to GLIBC 2.27, available starting
with Ubuntu 18 and RedHat 8.
