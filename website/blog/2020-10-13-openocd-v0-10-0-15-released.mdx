The [xPack OpenOCD](https://xpack-dev-tools.github.io/openocd-xpack/)
is the **xPack** distribution of
[OpenOCD](https://openocd.org).

There are binaries for **x64 Windows**,
**macOS** (x64) and **GNU/Linux** (x64 and x86, arm64 and arm).

:::note Raspberry Pi

The main targets for the GNU/Linux Arm
binaries are the **Raspberry Pi** class devices (armv7l and aarch64;
armv6 is not supported).

:::

## Download

The binary files are available from <a href={frontMatter.download_url}>GitHub Releases</a>.

## Install

The easiest way to install this specific version, is by using **xpm**:

<CodeBlock language="console"> {
`xpm install @xpack-dev-tools/openocd@${frontMatter.version}.${frontMatter.npm_subversion} -verbose
`} </CodeBlock>

Comprehensive instructions for installing **xPack OpenOCD** on different platforms
can be found in the [Install Guide](/docs/install/).

## Compliance

The **xPack OpenOCD** generally follows the official
[OpenOCD](https://openocd.org) releases.

The current version is based on:

- OpenOCD version 0.10.0, the development commit
[3ffa14b04](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/openocd/commit/3ffa14b043225b9766132b1979db7ddb8d91ba5e)
from October 11, 2020.

## Changes

There are no functional changes.

Compared to the upstream, the following changes were applied:

- a configure option was added to configure branding (`--enable-branding`)
- the `src/openocd.c` file was edited to display the branding string
- the `contrib/60-openocd.rules` file was simplified to avoid protection
  related issues.

## Documentation

The original documentation is available in the `share/doc` folder.

## Supported platforms

Binaries for **Windows**, **macOS** and **Intel/Arm GNU/Linux** are provided.

The binaries were built using the
[xPack Build Box (XBB)](https://github.com/xpack/xpack-build-box), a set
of build environments based on slightly older distributions, that should be
compatible with most recent systems.

- x86/x64 GNU/Linux: all binaries were built with GCC 9.3, running in an
  Ubuntu 12 Docker container
- arm64/arm GNU/Linux: all binaries were built with GCC 9.3, running in an
  Ubuntu 16 Docker container (added in mid-2020)
- x86/x64 Windows: all binaries were built with mingw-w64 GCC 9.3, running in an
  Ubuntu 12 Docker container
- x64 macOS: all binaries were built with GCC 9.3, running in a separate
  folder on macOS 10.10.5.

## Build

The scripts used to build this distribution are in:

- `distro-info/scripts`

For the prerequisites and more details on the build procedure, please see the
[README-MAINTAINER](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/openocd-xpack/blob/xpack/README-MAINTAINER.md) page.

## Travis tests

The first set of tests were performed on Travis, by running
a simple script to check if the binaries start on a wide range of
platforms and distributions:

- [test xPack OpenOCD on stable platforms](https://travis-ci.org/github/xpack-dev-tools/openocd-xpack/builds/735490849)
- [test xPack OpenOCD on latest platforms](https://travis-ci.org/github/xpack-dev-tools/openocd-xpack/builds/735491108)

## Tests

The binaries were testes on Windows 11 Pro, Intel Ubuntu 22
LTS and macOS 14.5.

Install the package with xpm.

The simple test, consists in starting the binaries
only to identify the STM32F4DISCOVERY board.

<CodeBlock language="sh"> {
`~/Library/xPacks/@xpack-dev-tools/openocd/${frontMatter.version}.${frontMatter.npm_subversion}/.content/bin/openocd -f board/stm32f4discovery.cfg`
} </CodeBlock>

A more complex test consist in programming and debugging a simple blinky
application on the STM32F4DISCOVERY board. The binaries were
those generated by the
[simple Eclipse projects](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack/tree/xpack/tests/eclipse)
available in the **xPack GNU Arm Embedded GCC** project.
