The first benefit of using this distribution is **user convenience**, on Windows and macOS the program is packed as a Setup package.

The current stable release of OpenOCD is 0.8.0; although a bit old, GNU ARM Eclipse follows this version, with no functional changes.

A new release to include the latest development version from the project Git is planned in the near future.
