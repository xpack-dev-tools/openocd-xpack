## Development version

For those who want the latest OpenOCD features before the stable version is announced, the latest OpenOCD version built from the development repository was released in packages explicitly marked as `-dev`.

## A word of caution

The OpenOCD developers claim that the development versions should be generally safe to use. In case you encounter problems, please revert to the latest 0.9.0 stable release.

## Configuration update

The debug plug-in generally discovers the latest installed version, by using the Windows registry keys or by searching several designated folders. If you need to use a different version, update the `$\{openocd_path\}` variable accordingly.

## Changes

In addition to the official OpenOCD changes, the only small functional improvement is a patch that allows silent Windows setups to install in a custom location, using the `/D` command line switch.

## Known problems

* none so far

## Download

The new OpenOCD can be downloaded from the <a href={ frontMatter.download_url }>GitHub Releases</a> page.
