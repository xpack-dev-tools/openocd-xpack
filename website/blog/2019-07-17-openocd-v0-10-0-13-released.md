Version **0.10.0-13** is a maintenance release of **xPack OpenOCD**; it updates to the latest upstream master.

<!-- truncate -->

[The xPack OpenOCD](https://xpack.github.io/openocd/)
is a standalone cross-platform binary distribution of
[OpenOCD](https://openocd.org).

There are separate binaries for **Windows**, **macOS** and
**GNU/Linux**, 32/64-bit.

## Download

The binary files are available from GitHub
<a href={frontMatter.download_url}>Releases</a>.

## Install

The full details of installing the **xPack OpenOCD** on various platforms
are presented in the separate
[Install](/docs/install/) page.

### Easy install

The easiest way to install OpenOCD is with
[`xpm`](https://xpack.github.io/xpm/)
by using the **binary xPack**, available as
[`@xpack-dev-tools/openocd`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@xpack-dev-tools/openocd)
from the [`npmjs.com`](https://www.npmjs.com) registry.

To install the latest version available, use:

```sh
xpm install --global @xpack-dev-tools/openocd@latest --verbose
```

To install this specific version, use:

<CodeBlock language="sh">
{'xpm install @xpack-dev-tools/openocd@' + frontMatter.version + '.' + frontMatter.npm_subversion + ' --verbose'}
</CodeBlock>

## Compliance

The xPack OpenOCD generally follows the official
[OpenOCD](https://openocd.org) releases.

The current version is based on:

- OpenOCD version 0.10.0, the development commit
[263deb380](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/openocd/commit/263deb3802a515ba8155b6c59146f0f539de4e43)
from 7 July 2019

## Changes

There are no functional changes.

Compared to the upstream, the following changes were applied:

- a configure option was added to configure branding (`--enable-branding`)
- the `src/openocd.c` file was edited to display the branding string
- the `contrib/60-openocd.rules` file was simplified to avoid protection
  related issues.

## Known problems

- none

## Documentation

The original documentation is available in the `share/doc` folder.

## Supported platforms

Binaries for **Windows**, **macOS** and **GNU/Linux** are provided.

The binaries were built using the
[xPack Build Box (XBB)](https://github.com/xpack/xpack-build-box), a set
of build environments based on slightly older distributions, that should be
compatible with most recent systems.

- GNU/Linux: all binaries were built with GCC 7.4, running in a CentOS 6
  Docker container
- Windows: all binaries were built with mingw-w64 GCC 7.4, running in a
  CentOS 6 Docker container
- macOS: most binaries were built with GCC 7.4, running in a separate
  folder on macOS 10.10.5; GDB cannot be compiled with GCC, so Apple
  clang was used.

## Tests

The binaries were testes on Windows 10 Pro 32/64-bit, Ubuntu 18 LTS 64-bit,
Xubuntu 18 LTS 32-bit and macOS 10.13.

The tests consist in programming and debugging a simple blinky application
on the STM32F4DISCOVERY board. The binaries were
those generated by
[simple Eclipse projects](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack/tree/xpack/tests/eclipse)
available in the **xPack GNU Arm Embedded GCC** project.
