After some experimentation with modern site generators,
the **xPack OpenOCD**
project has a new web site.

<!--truncate-->

## MDX

The _new kid on the block_ is [MDX](https://mdxjs.com), that is a solution
to integrate [JSX](https://react.dev/learn/writing-markup-with-jsx) with
markdown.

The result is a static site (kind of), enhanced with lots of JavaScript
code, specific to [React](https://react.dev) components.

## Docusaurus

The tool used to generate the site is [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io),
a highly successful open source project.

## Minimal README

The content of the `README.md` file was migrated to the
[Getting Started](/docs/getting-started/) page
