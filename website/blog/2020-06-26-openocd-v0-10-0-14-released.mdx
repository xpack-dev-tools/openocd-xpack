The [xPack OpenOCD](https://xpack-dev-tools.github.io/openocd-xpack)
is the **xPack** distribution of
[OpenOCD](https://openocd.org).

There are separate binaries for **Windows**, **macOS** and
**GNU/Linux**, 32/64-bit.

Starting with this version, support for 32/64-bit **Arm GNU/Linux** platforms,
like **Raspberry Pi**, was added.

## Download

The binary files are available from <a href={frontMatter.download_url}>GitHub Releases</a>.

## Install

The easiest way to install this specific version, is by using **xpm**:

<CodeBlock language="console"> {
`xpm install @xpack-dev-tools/openocd@${frontMatter.version}.${frontMatter.npm_subversion} -verbose
`} </CodeBlock>

Comprehensive instructions for installing **xPack OpenOCD** on different platforms
can be found in the [Install Guide](/docs/install/).

## Compliance

The **xPack OpenOCD** generally follows the official
[OpenOCD](https://openocd.org) releases.

The current version is based on:

- OpenOCD version 0.10.0, the development commit
[e5be992df](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/openocd/commit/e5be992df1a893e2e865419a02a564d5f9ccd9dd)
from June 23, 2020

To get a list of changes since the previous release, use `git log` in the
`xpack-dev-tools/openocd` project

```sh
git log --pretty='%cd * %h %s' --date=short 'v0.10.0-13'..'v0.10.0-14'
```

## Changes

There are no functional changes.

Compared to the upstream, the following changes were applied:

- a configure option was added to configure branding (`--enable-branding`)
- the `src/openocd.c` file was edited to display the branding string
- the `contrib/60-openocd.rules` file was simplified to avoid protection
  related issues.

## Known problems

- none

## Documentation

The original documentation is available in the `share/doc` folder.

## Supported platforms

Binaries for **Windows**, **macOS** and **Intel/Arm GNU/Linux** are provided.

The binaries were built using the
[xPack Build Box (XBB)](https://github.com/xpack/xpack-build-box), a set
of build environments based on slightly older distributions, that should be
compatible with most recent systems.

- x86/x64 GNU/Linux: all binaries were built with GCC 9.3, running in an
  Ubuntu 12 Docker container
- arm64/arm GNU/Linux: all binaries were built with GCC 9.3, running in an
  Ubuntu 16 Docker container (added in mid-2020)
- x86/x64 Windows: all binaries were built with mingw-w64 GCC 9.3, running in an
  Ubuntu 12 Docker container
- x64 macOS: all binaries were built with GCC 9.3, running in a separate
  folder on macOS 10.10.5.

## Build

The scripts used to build this distribution are in:

- `distro-info/scripts`

For the prerequisites and more details on the build procedure, please see the
[README-MAINTAINER](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/openocd-xpack/blob/xpack/README-MAINTAINER.md) page.

## Travis tests

The first set of tests were performed on Travis, by running
a simple script to check if the binaries start on a wide range of
platforms and distributions:

- [test xPack OpenOCD on stable platforms](https://travis-ci.org/github/xpack-dev-tools/openocd-xpack/builds/702320342)
- [test xPack OpenOCD on latest platforms](https://travis-ci.org/github/xpack-dev-tools/openocd-xpack/builds/702325083)

## Tests

The binaries were testes on Windows 10 Pro 32/64-bit, Intel Ubuntu 18 LTS 64-bit,
Intel Xubuntu 18 LTS 32-bit and macOS 10.15.

The tests consist in programming and debugging a simple blinky application
on the STM32F4DISCOVERY board. The binaries were
those generated by the
[simple Eclipse projects](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack/tree/xpack/tests/eclipse)
available in the **xPack GNU Arm Embedded GCC** project.

On Arm platforms, where Eclipse is not yet available, the binaries were
tested on Raspberry Pi OS 10 (buster) 32/64-bit only to identify the STM32F4DISCOVERY board.

<CodeBlock language="sh"> {
`~/Library/xPacks/@xpack-dev-tools/openocd/${frontMatter.version}.${frontMatter.npm_subversion}/.content/bin/openocd -f board/stm32f4discovery.cfg`
} </CodeBlock>

In all cases, install the archive in Downloads and configure the path
in Eclipse or run manually from there.
