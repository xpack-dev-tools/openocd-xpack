<summary>Flatpack & Snap also promise universal packages, why not use them?</summary>

The short answer is… _“because they run only on GNU/Linux”_.

Both [Flatpack](https://flatpak.org) and [Snap](https://snapcraft.io)
hold promise as the future of application distribution. While they may
eventually achieve this, they are currently specific to GNU/Linux, with
very little chance of expanding to other platforms.
