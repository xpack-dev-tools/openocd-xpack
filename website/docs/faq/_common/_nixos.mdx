<summary>Nix also provides reproducible builds, why not use it?</summary>

The short answer is… _“because of Windows”_.

[Nix](https://nixos.org/) is a remarkable project that carefully
controls versions down to individual libraries. However, it relies
on file links, which are either unavailable or unreliable on Windows.

As a result, Nix is currently only available on GNU/Linux and, with
some limitations, on macOS. Additionally, mastering the Nix language
requires significant effort.
