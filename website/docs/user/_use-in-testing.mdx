## Using openocd in testing

OpenOCD provides a fairly good implementation of Arm semihosting
which can be used for automated testing. For this the application must
be build with full semihosting support.

:::note

The details of semihosted builds
are beyound the scope of this page.

:::

### CMake example

The easiest way to build automated tests is with CMake in xPack applications.

:::tip Windows

Since on Windows the xPack OpenOCD uses `.cmd` forwarders, it is necessary
to explicitly define the extension, later used when invoking `openocd`:

```cmake
if("${CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_NAME}" STREQUAL "Windows")
  set(extension ".cmd")
endif()
```

:::

To run the test, the semihosted application must be first programmed
into the board and executed in an environment with semihosting enabled.

An example of such a test running on a STM32F4 board can be:

```cmake
if (ENABLE_RTOS_APIS_TEST)

  add_executable(rtos-apis-test)
  set_target_properties(rtos-apis-test PROPERTIES OUTPUT_NAME "rtos-apis-test")

  // ... definitions to build the application with semihosting support ...

  add_test(
    NAME "rtos-apis-test"

    COMMAND openocd${extension}
      # -d3
      -c "gdb_port disabled"
      -c "tcl_port disabled"
      -c "telnet_port disabled"
      -f interface/stlink-dap.cfg
      -f target/stm32f4x.cfg
      -c "program rtos-apis-test.elf verify"
      -c "arm semihosting enable"
      -c "arm semihosting_cmdline rtos-apis-test"
      -c "reset"
    )

endif ()
```

:::tip

The commands to disable the various ports are required to avoid
possible port collisions with other debug sessions or tests running
in parallel on other boards.

The commented out `-d3` is there for just in case something wrong
happens, to enable a detailed debug log.

:::

In an xPack application, the tests can be invoked by running an xPack action,
like this:

```sh
xpm run test
```

This asssumes that in `package.json` there is an action named `test`
and that all required tools were previously installed:

```json
{
  "...": "...",

  "xpack": {
    "actions": {
      "...": "...",
      "test": "ctest -V"
    },
    "devDependencies": {
      "@xpack-dev-tools/cmake": "3.26.5-1.1",
      "@xpack-dev-tools/ninja-build": "1.11.1-3.1",
      "@xpack-dev-tools/openocd": "0.12.0-3.1",
      "@xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc": "12.3.1-1.2.1"
    }
  }
}
```

The xPack action runs the defined command (`ctest -V` in this case)
in an environment where `xpacks/.bin` is prepended to the PATH, so
the tools installed locally by **xpm** are available and prefered to
possibly other similar tools installed in the system, thus
achieving a good reproducibility.
