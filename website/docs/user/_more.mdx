## Drivers

### Windows drivers

Most JTAG probes require separate drivers on Windows.
For additional information, please refer to the
[Install Guide](/docs/install/) page.

### GNU/Linux UDEV subsystem

For the JTAG probes implemented as USB devices (actually most of them),
the last installation step on GNU/Linux is to configure the UDEV subsystem.
For additional information, please refer to the
[Install Guide](https://xpack.github.io/openocd/install/) page.

### macOS

On macOS, JTAG probes implemented as USB devices usually are
recognised directly and do not need explicit drivers.
