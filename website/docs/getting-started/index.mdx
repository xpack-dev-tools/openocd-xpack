## Overview

**xPack OpenOCD** is a standalone
cross-platform (Windows, macOS, GNU/Linux) binary
distribution of OpenOCD,
aimed at reproducible builds.

<details>
<summary>What are reproducible builds?</summary>

To be **reproducible**, an operation must remain stable over time and
across different environments. In other words, if builds are repeated
after some time, possibly on a different machine or platform, the
resulting behavior must be functionally equivalent.

</details>

<Overview/>

The open source **xPack OpenOCD** project is hosted on GitHub as
[`xpack-dev-tools/openocd-xpack`](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/openocd-xpack);
it provides the platform specific binaries as
[release assets](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/openocd-xpack/releases).

In addition to the binary archives and the package metadata,
this project also includes the
[build scripts](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/openocd-xpack/tree/xpack/build-assets/scripts).

<UpgradeNotice/>

## xPacks

<details>
<summary>What the heck are xPacks? Please, not yet another package format!</summary>

**xPacks** are general purpose multi-version software packages.

There are two types of xPacks:

- **source xPacks** (that install source files, usually libraries) and
- **binary xPacks** (that install executables/binary files, usually tools).

The xPacks project **does NOT introduce a new package format**; instead,
it uses **the same format as npm**, which is a collection of files/folders
and a `package.json` file with the package metadata. Additionally,
installing binary xPacks also installs the archives with the platform specific
binaries (such as `.tar.gz` for Unix or `.zip` for Windows).

Also, xPacks can be installed from the
same repositories as **npm** packages, whether public or private.

xPacks are managed by **[xpm](https://xpack.github.io/xpm/)**
(the xPack Project Manager),
a program that complements the **[npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/)** CLI (the
popular JavaScript package manager),
with new language-neutral features.

There is no magic behind **xpm**, it operates straightforwardly by
unpacking platform-specific archives into distinct directories and then creating links in the project to the corresponding executables.

In short, xPacks are just a way to automate installing source libraries and
tools.

</details>


## Features

All binaries are:

- **self-contained** (include all required libraries)
- **file-system relocatable** (can be installed in any location)
- built on slightly older systems (to make them run on both old and new systems)

<details>
<summary>Compatibility with older systems</summary>

Given that most operating systems maintain significant compatibility
with older versions, building an application on an older system ensures
that the same binary can run on newer versions. Conversely, building an
application on a newer system may utilize library features that are
not available in older versions, making backward compatibility less
feasible.

</details>

## Benefits

The main advantages of using the **xPack OpenOCD** are:

- a convenient, uniform and portable install/uninstall/upgrade
procedure; the same procedure is used for all major
  platforms (**x64 Windows**, **x64 macOS**, **arm64 macOS**, **x64 GNU/Linux**, **arm64 GNU/Linux**, **arm GNU/Linux**)
- multiple versions of the same package can be installed at the same time on
  the same system
- no need to worry about dependent libraries, they are all included
- significantly lighter and easier to use than Docker images that provide
  similar functionality and are GNU/Linux centric
- projects can be tied to specific tools versions; this provides a good
  reproducibility, especially useful in **CI/CD** environments.

## Install

The executables and other related files can be installed automatically with
**xpm** via the **binary xPacks** or manually by downloading the
**platform specific archives**.

The details of installing the **xPack OpenOCD** on various platforms are
presented in the
[Install Guide](/docs/install/).

However, the ultimate source for details are the build scripts themselves,
all available from the
[`openocd-xpack.git/build-assets/scripts`](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/openocd-xpack/tree/xpack/build-assets/scripts/)
folder. The scripts include common code from the [`@xpack-dev-tools/xbb-helper`](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/xbb-helper-xpack) package.
