## Release schedule

This distribution generally follows the official
[GCC release](https://gcc.gnu.org/releases.html) timeline.

For each major version there are 2 releases, like **{versionMajor()}.1**
in the first part of the year (tentatively April-May) and
**{versionMajor()}.2** in the second part
(tentatively in August-September).

Previous versions are maintained for 3 more years, and, around midyear,
GNU releases updates for the previous 3 versions,
(like **{versionMajor() - 1}.3**, **{versionMajor() - 2}.4**, **{versionMajor() - 3}.5**).
