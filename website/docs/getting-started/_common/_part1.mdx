## Overview

**xPack OpenOCD** is a standalone cross-platform (Windows, macOS, GNU/Linux)
binary distribution of [OpenOCD](https://openocd.org),
intended for reproducible builds.

OpenOCD, the **Open On-Chip Debugger**, is an open source project hosted on
[SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/p/openocd/code/).

**xPack OpenOCD** is an open source project hosted on GitHub as
[`xpack-dev-tools/openocd-xpack`](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/openocd-xpack);
it provides the platform specific binaries as
[release assets](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/openocd-xpack/releases).

In addition to the binary archives and the package metadata,
this project also includes the
[build scripts](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/openocd-xpack/tree/xpack/scripts).

## Features

All binaries are:

- **self-contained** (include all required libraries)
- **file-system relocatable** (can be installed in any location)
- built on a slightly older system (to make them run on a wide range of systems)

## Benefits

The main advantages of using the **xPack OpenOCD** are:

- a convenient, uniform and portable install/uninstall/upgrade procedure;
  the same procedure is used for all major
  platforms (**Intel Windows** 64-bit,
  **Intel GNU/Linux** 64-bit,
  **Arm GNU/Linux** 64/32-bit,
  **Intel macOS** 64-bit,
  **Apple Silicon macOS** 64-bit)
- multiple versions of the same package can be installed at the same time on
  the same system
- no need to worry about dependent libraries, all are included
- a good integration with development environments (no need for Docker images)
- projects can be tied to specific tools versions; this provides a good
  reproducibility, especially useful in **CI/CD** environments.
