The **xPack OpenOCD** can be installed automatically, using the `xpm` command
(the recommended method), or manually, by downloading and unpacking one of the
portable archives.

## Automated install

The easiest (and recommended) way to install OpenOCD
is by using the **binary xPack**, available
as <a href={ `https://www.npmjs.com/package/@xpack-dev-tools/openocd` }><code>@xpack-dev-tools/openocd</code></a> from
the [`npmjs.com`](https://www.npmjs.com) registry.

<details>
<summary>xPacks 101</summary>

While the initial appearance may seem complex, utilizing xPacks is,
in fact, straightforward. The design rationale is to automate frequent
operations that occur during software development, in this case the
installation of
dependencies, and to ensure reproducibility.

xPacks are standard archives that are extracted into separate folders
within the project. If the xPacks contain
executables, links/forwarders to
these executables are created in a `.bin` folder,
eliminating the need to add multiple folders to the `PATH`.

Given that some binary xPacks, such as toolchains, can be quite large,
the archives are extracted only once into a user global location to
conserve space. In projects, instead of duplicating the content of these
archives, symbolic links are created.

</details>

### Prerequisites

The only requirement for an automated install is a recent
[xpm](https://xpack.github.io/xpm/), which is a portable
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) command line application
that complements [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com)
with several extra features specific to
**C/C++ projects**.

To install **xpm**,
follow the instructions in the
[xpm install](https://xpack.github.io/xpm/install/) page.

If already installed, it is always a good idea to update it to the
latest version with:

```sh
npm install --location=global xpm@latest
```

:::tip

Although not mandated by **xpm**, it is also a good idea to upgrade
**npm** to the latest version, and
**node** to a reasonably recent version (currently **npm** requires
a **node** >=18.17.0).

:::

<details>
<summary>Local installs</summary>

One of the xPack design goals is to allow each project to
choose the exact versions of the tools it requires.

Similarly to **npm** being able to install specific versions of the
JavaScript tools into each project,
**xpm** was also designed to be able to install specific versions of the
required binary tools locally into each project.

Therefore, similarly to the way **npm** installs the JavaScript packages into
`node_modules`, **xpm** installs the binary tools into
`xpacks`. Here there will be separate folders with the installed
packages, for example
<code>xpacks/@xpack-dev-tools/openocd</code>.

Each such folder includes the `package.json` file with the
project metadata and a sub-folder `.content` with the extracted
binary archive. The executables are usually in `.content/bin`.

:::tip

On some platforms, names starting with `.` (dot) might be hidden for
normal browsing, and seeing them requires
separate options (like `ls -A`) or, in file browsers, to enable
settings like **Show Hidden Files**.

:::

</details>

<details>
<summary>The `xpacks/.bin` folder</summary>

If multiple binary packages are installed, in order to allow
the executables to be accessed, one possible solution is to add
all `<package>/.content/bin` folders to the `PATH`.

To simplify things, **npm** employs a separate `node_modules/.bin` folder
where it places links/forwarders
pointing to the actual executable files.

Similarly, **xpm** adds links/forwarders into
a separate `xpacks/.bin` folder.

With this setup, the project needs to prepend only this `.bin` folder
to the `PATH`, and all the required tools are accesible
and prefered to possible system tools.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Global installs and the user global xPacks store</summary>

Given that some binary tools (such as toolchains) can be very large
(hundreds of megabytes or more), it is impractical to keep multiple
copies of these tools, one for each project.

Instead, **xpm** installs the binary packages only once
into a user global store (a platform-dependent folder
within the home folder), thereby conserving disk space when the same
tools are used across multiple projects.

In order to allow the projects to access the binary tools installed in the
user global store, instead of unpacking the archives in `xpacks`,
**xpm** adds symbolic links pointing to the **user global xPacks store**.

The outcome is functionally equivalent to installing the tools into
each project, but without the wasted disk space.

:::tip

It is possible to force a local install into a project
by passing `--copy` to `xpm install`.

:::

If needed, it is also possible to install packages only globally, without
creating local links/forwarders (see below).

</details>

<details>
<summary>The user xPacks cache</summary>

To save download time, all archives are first stored in a
cache, and all subsequent downloads are replaced with the
cached content.

Therefore all published archives should be read-only and
it is not allowed to replace them at a later time.

</details>

### Initialise the project

Upon initial use, ensure that a `package.json` file is present in the
project root folder.

This can be achieved by running `xpm init` in the desired project folder
(substitute `my-project` accordingly):

```sh
cd my-project
xpm init
```

<details>
<summary>Under the hood</summary>

The main purpose of `xpm init` is to create a `package.json` file, if not
already present.

In addition to `name` & `version`, the minimal `package.json` must
include a property named `xpacks`, even empty. This property is
mandatory to identify the package as an **xPack**.

</details>

### Install into the project

The next step is to install the
**openocd** package into the project:

<CodeBlock language="sh"> {
`xpm install @xpack-dev-tools/openocd@latest --verbose`
} </CodeBlock>

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
<TabItem value="windows" label="Windows" default>

The main result is a set
of forwarders in
the `.bin` folder:

<CodeBlock language="console"> {
`dir xpacks\\.bin`
} </CodeBlock>

<details>
<summary>PATH setup</summary>

With all binary tools installed in `xpacks/.bin`, the project build
configurations need only a single PATH adjustment:

```sh
export PATH=<...project-path...>/xpacks/.bin:$PATH
```

:::tip

This syntax is for the Git Bash console.
When using COMMAND.EXE or Power Shell,
adjust the syntax for the corresponding Windows specific shell.

:::
</details>

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="macos" label="macOS">

The main result is a set
of links in
the `.bin` folder:

<CodeBlock language="console"> {
`ls -l xpacks/.bin`
} </CodeBlock>

<details>
<summary>PATH setup</summary>

With all binary tools installed in `xpacks/.bin`, the project build
configurations need only a single PATH adjustment:

```sh
export PATH=<...project-path...>/xpacks/.bin:$PATH
```
</details>

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="linux" label="GNU/Linux">

The main result is a set
of links in
the `.bin` folder:

<CodeBlock language="console"> {
`ls -l xpacks/.bin`
} </CodeBlock>

<details>
<summary>PATH setup</summary>

With all binary tools installed in `xpacks/.bin`, the project build
configurations need only a single PATH adjustment:

```sh
export PATH=<...project-path...>/xpacks/.bin:$PATH
```
</details>

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<details>
<summary>Installation details</summary>

The above `xpm install` command will do the following:

* identify the platform specific archive for the latest available version
  of OpenOCD, download it into a cache and unpack
  it into a versioned folder
  in the **user global xPacks store** (if not already there);
  check the output of the `xpm install` command for the actual
  folder used on your platform;
* create a local symbolic link
  like <code>xpacks/@xpack-dev-tools/openocd</code> pointing to the
  versioned folder in the user global xPacks store
* add links/forwarders into
  the local `xpacks/.bin` folder, referring to the binaries in
  <code>xpacks/@xpack-dev-tools/openocd/.content/bin</code>;
* add <code>@xpack-dev-tools/openocd</code> to
  `package.json` as a
  development dependency; this associates a specific version of OpenOCD with
  the current project (details below).

:::tip

The install location can be configured using the
`XPACKS_STORE_FOLDER` environment variable; for more details please check the
[xpm folders](https://xpack.github.io/xpm/folders/) page.

:::

</details>

<details>
<summary>Reproducibility and `devDependencies`</summary>

To ensure reproducibility, it is essential for each project to always
use the exact desired versions of the required tools, regardless of the
tools installed in the system.

To achieve this goal, **xpm** records all locally installed binary packages
as development dependencies in the project `package.json` file.

The result looks like this:

<CodeBlock language="json"> {
`  "xpack": {
    "minimumXpmRequired": "0.19.1",
    "dependencies": {},
    "devDependencies": {
      "@xpack-dev-tools/openocd": {
        "specifier": "${ customField('upstreamVersion') }-${ customField('xpackSubversion') }.${ customField('npmSubversion') }",
        "local": "link",
        "platforms": "all"
      }
    },
    "properties": {},
    "actions": {},
    "buildConfigurations": {}
  }`
} </CodeBlock>

If the `package.json` is saved in the revision system, the above
definition acts as a hard reference to the specific version of
**xPack OpenOCD**.

After cloning the project into a different location, the command `xpm install`
can be used to install all development dependencies.

This is particularly useful for CI/CD environments.

</details>

### Install globally

For older development environments,
it is also possible to install OpenOCD only globally in
the **user global xPacks store**, without any
local links/forwarders; it
is the developer's responsibility to configure the path to the tools.

No other files are installed in any system folders or other locations.

<CodeBlock language="sh"> {
`xpm install @xpack-dev-tools/openocd@latest --global --verbose`
} </CodeBlock>

:::note

Installing packages locally into a project always installs the
packages in the **user global xPacks store**; subsequent attempts to
install the packages globally will fail with _already installed_.

:::


<details>
<summary>PATH setup</summary>

In order to access the GNU RISC-V Embedded GCC binaries installed in
the user global xPacks store,
the project build configurations need a PATH adjustment:

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
<TabItem value="windows" label="Windows" default>

<CodeBlock language="sh"> {
`export PATH=$HOME/AppData/Roaming/xPacks/\@pack-dev-tools/openocd /${ customField('upstreamVersion') }-${ customField('xpackSubversion') }.${ customField('npmSubversion') }/.content/bin:$PATH`
} </CodeBlock>

:::tip

When not using the Git console, adjust the syntax for the
corresponding shell.

:::

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="macos" label="macOS">

<CodeBlock language="sh"> {
`export PATH=$HOME/Library/xPacks/\@pack-dev-tools/openocd /${ customField('upstreamVersion') }-${ customField('xpackSubversion') }.${ customField('npmSubversion') }/.content/bin:$PATH`
} </CodeBlock>

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="linux" label="GNU/Linux">

<CodeBlock language="sh"> {
`export PATH=$HOME/.local/xPacks/@xpack-dev-tools/openocd /${ customField('upstreamVersion') }-${ customField('xpackSubversion') }.${ customField('npmSubversion') }/.content/bin:$PATH`
} </CodeBlock>

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

</details>


### Uninstall

The binaries do not use any form of installer; instead they
are distributed as
portable { props.isWindows ? <code>.zip</code> : <code>.tar.gz</code> } archives;
therefore they do not require to run any uninstaller; simply removing the
links and possibly the user global xPack store folder and
the user xPack cache folder is enough.

To remove the <LinksVsForwarders isWindows={ props.isWindows }/> created by
**xpm** in the current project,
go to the project folder:

```sh
cd my-project
```

and ask **xpm** to uninstall the package:

<CodeBlock language="sh"> {
`xpm uninstall @xpack-dev-tools/openocd --verbose`
} </CodeBlock>

To completely remove the package from the user global xPack store:

<CodeBlock language="sh"> {
`xpm uninstall --global @xpack-dev-tools/openocd --verbose`
} </CodeBlock>

<details>
<summary>Clean-ups</summary>

For a thorough clean-up, please note that **xpm** uses only two folders:

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
<TabItem value="windows" label="Windows" default>

- `%APPDATA%\Roaming\xPacks`
- `%APPDATA%\Local\Caches\xPacks`

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="macos" label="macOS">

- `${HOME}/Library/xPacks`
- `${HOME}/Library/Caches/xPacks`

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="linux" label="GNU/Linux">

- `${HOME}/.local/xPacks`
- `${HOME}/.cache/xPacks`

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

They can be removed at any time and space reclaimed;
**xpm** will recreate them on new installs.

However, projects linking to the user global xPack store will fail with
broken paths.

## Manual install

For all platforms, the **xPack OpenOCD** binaries are released as portable
archives that can be installed in any location.

The archives can be downloaded from
the <a href={ `https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/openocd-xpack/releases/` }>GitHub Releases</a> pages.

### Download & unpack {#manual-install-download-and-unpack}

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
<TabItem value="windows" label="Windows" default>

The Windows versions of **xPack OpenOCD**
are packed as `.zip` files.
Download the latest version named like:

* <code>xpack-openocd-{ customField('upstreamVersion') }-{ customField('xpackSubversion') }-win32-x64.zip</code>

:::note

In case you wonder where the suffix comes
from, it is exactly the Node.js `process.platform` and `process.arch`.
The `win32` part is confusing, but we have to live with it.

:::

To manually install the <b>xPack OpenOCD</b>,
unpack the archive and move it to a location of your choice.

The recommended location is
the <code>%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Roaming\\xPacks\\openocd</code> folder, for
example <code>C:\\Users\\ilg\\AppData\\Roaming\\xPacks\\openocd\\xpack-openocd-{ customField('upstreamVersion') }-{ customField('xpackSubversion') }</code>.

:::note

According to Microsoft, <code>AppData\\Roaming</code> is the recommended location for
installing user specific packages.
