## Testing

To test if OpenOCD is able to connect to a specific board, it is generally necessary to select the interface and the processor. As a shortcut, for some well known boards, there are ready made configuration files to set both the interface and the processor. For example to test a connection via ST/LINK to the STM32F4DISCOVERY board, you can use something like this:

<CodeBlock language="console"> {
`$ .../xPacks/@xpack-dev-tools/openocd/${ customField('upstreamVersion') }-${ customField('xpackSubversion') }.${ customField('npmSubversion') }/.content/bin/openocd -f board/stm32f4discovery.cfg
xPack OpenOCD x86_64 Open On-Chip Debugger ${ customField('upstreamVersion') }+dev
