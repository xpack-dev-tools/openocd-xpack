## Automated install

The easiest (and recommended) way to install OpenOCD on { props.label }
is by using the **binary xPack**, available
as <a href={ `https://www.npmjs.com/package/@xpack-dev-tools/openocd` }><code>@xpack-dev-tools/openocd</code></a> from
the [`npmjs.com`](https://www.npmjs.com) registry.

### Prerequisites

The only requirement for an automated install is a recent
[xpm](https://xpack.github.io/xpm/), which is a portable
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) command line application
that complements [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com)
with several extra features specific to
**C/C++ projects**.

To install **xpm**,
follow the instructions in the
[xpm install](https://xpack.github.io/xpm/install/) page.

If already installed, it is always a good idea to update it to the
latest version with:

```sh
npm install --location=global xpm@latest
```

:::tip

Although not mandated by **xpm**, it is also a good idea to upgrade
**npm** to the latest version, and
**node** to a reasonably recent version (currently **npm** requires
a **node** >=18.17.0).

<details>
<summary>Local vs. global installs</summary>

To ensure reproducibility, it is essential for each project to be able to
use specific versions of each tool.

Similarly to **npm** being able to install specific versions of the
JavaScript tools into each project,
**xpm** was also designed to be able to install specific versions of the
required binary tools into each project.

Thus, similarly to the JavaScript tools installed by **npm** in
`node_modules/.bin`, **xpm** installs the binary tools in
`xpacks/.bin`.
</details>

<details>
<summary>The central xPacks store</summary>

Given that some binary tools (such as toolchains) can be very large
(hundreds of megabytes or more), it is impractical to maintain multiple
copies of these tools, one for each project.

Instead, **xpm** installs the binary packages into a platform-dependent folder
within the home directory, thereby conserving disk space when these tools are
used across multiple projects.

Then, in order to allow the projects to access the binary tools,
**xpm** adds <LinksVsForwarders isWindows={ props.isWindows }/>
into the projects pointing to the **central xPacks store**.

The outcome is functionally equivalent to installing the tools in each project,
but without the wasted disk space.

:::tip

It is possible to force a local install by passyng `--copy` to `xpm install`.

:::

However, if needed, it is also possible to install packages only globally,
without creating local <LinksVsForwarders isWindows={ props.isWindows }/>
(see below).
</details>

### Initialise the project

Upon initial use, ensure that a `package.json` file is present in the
project root folder.

This can be achieved by running `xpm init` in the desired folder
(substitute `my-project` accordingly):

```sh
cd my-project
xpm init
```

### Install into the project

The next step is to install the
**openocd** package into the project:

<CodeBlock language="sh"> {
`xpm install @xpack-dev-tools/openocd@latest --verbose`
} </CodeBlock>

The main result is a set of <LinksVsForwarders isWindows={ props.isWindows }/>:

<CodeBlock language="console"> {
`${ props.isWindows === 'True' ? 'dir xpacks\\.bin' : 'ls -l xpacks/.bin' }`
} </CodeBlock>

<details>
<summary>PATH setup</summary>

With all binary tools installed in `xpacks/.bin`, the project build
configurations need a single PATH adjustment:

```sh
export PATH=<...project-path...>/xpacks/.bin:$PATH
```

{ props.isWindows === 'True' ?
  <Admonition type="tip">
    <p>When not using the Git console, adjust the syntax for the
  corresponding shell.</p>
  </Admonition>
 : ''
}
</details>

<details>
<summary>Installation details</summary>

The above `xpm install` command will do the following:

* identify the platform specific archive for the latest available version
  of OpenOCD, download it in a cache and unpack
  it into a versioned folder
  in the **central xPacks store** (if not already there);
  check the output of the `xpm` command for the actual
  folder used on your platform;
* add <LinksVsForwarders isWindows={ props.isWindows }/>
  into the local `xpacks/.bin` folder, referring to the binaries in the central store;
* add <code>@xpack-dev-tools/openocd</code> to
  `package.json` as a
  development dependency; this associates a specific version of OpenOCD with
  the current project (details below).

:::tip

The install location can be configured using the
`XPACKS_STORE_FOLDER` environment variable; for more details please check the
[xpm folders](https://xpack.github.io/xpm/folders/) page.

:::

:::tip

**xpm** unpacks the archive content into a folder
named `.content`. On some platforms
this might be hidden for normal browsing, and seeing it requires
separate options (like `ls -A`) or, in file browsers, to enable
settings like **Show Hidden Files**.

:::
</details>

<details>
<summary>devDependencies</summary>

As mentioned before, **xpm** adds all locally installed binary packages
as development dependencies in the project `package.json` file.

The result looks like this:

<CodeBlock language="json"> {
`  "xpack": {
    "minimumXpmRequired": "0.19.1",
    "dependencies": {},
    "devDependencies": {
      "@xpack-dev-tools/openocd": {
        "specifier": "${ customField('upstreamVersion') }-${ customField('xpackSubversion') }.${ customField('npmSubversion') }",
        "local": "link",
        "platforms": "all"
      }
    },
    "properties": {},
    "actions": {},
    "buildConfigurations": {}
  }`
} </CodeBlock>

If the `package.json` is saved in the revision system, the project gets
a hard reference to the specific version of
**xPack OpenOCD**.

After cloning the project to a different location, the command `xpm install`
can be used to install all development dependencies.

This is particularly useful for CI/CD environments.
</details>

### Install globally

For older development environments (like the initial **Eclipse Embedded C/C++ plug-ins**; the current version also supports project installs),
it is also possible to install OpenOCD only globally in the **central
xPacks store**, without any local <LinksVsForwarders isWindows={ props.isWindows }/>,
assuming the development environments are capable of handling
the paths themselves.

<CodeBlock language="sh"> {
`xpm install @xpack-dev-tools/openocd@latest --global --verbose`
} </CodeBlock>

:::note

Installing packages locally into a project always installs the
packages in the **central xPacks store**; subsequent attempts to
install the package globally will fail with _already installed_.
