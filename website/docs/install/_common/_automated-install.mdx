## Automated install

The easiest (and recommended) way to install OpenOCD on { props.label }
is by using the **binary xPack**, available
as <a href={ `https://www.npmjs.com/package/@xpack-dev-tools/openocd` }><code>@xpack-dev-tools/openocd</code></a> from
the [`npmjs.com`](https://www.npmjs.com) registry.

<details>
<summary>xPacks 101</summary>

While the initial appearance may seem complex, utilizing xPacks is,
in fact, straightforward. The design rationale is to automate frequent
operations that occur during software development, in this case the
installation of
dependencies, and to ensure reproducibility.

xPacks are standard archives that are extracted into separate folders
within the project. If the xPacks contain
executables, <LinksVsForwarders isWindows={ props.isWindows }/> to
these executables are created in a `.bin` folder,
eliminating the need to add multiple folders to the `PATH`.

Given that some binary xPacks, such as toolchains, can be quite large,
the archives are extracted only once into a central/global location to
conserve space. In projects, instead of duplicating the content of these
archives, symbolic links are created.

</details>

### Prerequisites

The only requirement for an automated install is a recent
[xpm](https://xpack.github.io/xpm/), which is a portable
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) command line application
that complements [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com)
with several extra features specific to
**C/C++ projects**.

To install **xpm**,
follow the instructions in the
[xpm install](https://xpack.github.io/xpm/install/) page.

If already installed, it is always a good idea to update it to the
latest version with:

```sh
npm install --location=global xpm@latest
```

:::tip

Although not mandated by **xpm**, it is also a good idea to upgrade
**npm** to the latest version, and
**node** to a reasonably recent version (currently **npm** requires
a **node** >=18.17.0).

:::

<details>
<summary>Local installs</summary>

One of the xPack design goals is to allow each project to
choose the exact versions of the tools it requires.

Similarly to **npm** being able to install specific versions of the
JavaScript tools into each project,
**xpm** was also designed to be able to install specific versions of the
required binary tools locally into each project.

Therefore, similarly to the way **npm** installs the JavaScript packages into
`node_modules`, **xpm** installs the binary tools into
`xpacks`. Here there will be separate folders with the installed
packages, for example
<code>xpacks/@xpack-dev-tools/openocd</code>.

Each such folder includes the `package.json` file with the
project metadata and a sub-folder `.content` with the extracted
binary archive. The executables are usually in `.content/bin`.

:::tip

On some platforms, names starting with `.` (dot) might be hidden for
normal browsing, and seeing them requires
separate options (like `ls -A`) or, in file browsers, to enable
settings like **Show Hidden Files**.

:::

</details>

<details>
<summary>The `xpacks/.bin` folder</summary>

If multiple binary packages are installed, in order to allow
the executables to be accessed, one possible solution is to add
all `<package>/.content/bin` folders to the `PATH`.

To simplify things, **npm** employs a separate `node_modules/.bin` folder
where it places <LinksVsForwarders isWindows={ props.isWindows }/>
pointing to the actual executable files.

Similarly, **xpm** adds <LinksVsForwarders isWindows={ props.isWindows }/> into
a separate `xpacks/.bin` folder.

With this setup, the project needs to prepend only this `.bin` folder
to the `PATH`, and all the required tools are accesible
and prefered to possible system tools.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Global installs and the central xPacks store</summary>

Given that some binary tools (such as toolchains) can be very large
(hundreds of megabytes or more), it is impractical to keep multiple
copies of these tools, one for each project.

Instead, **xpm** installs the binary packages only once
into a central store (a platform-dependent folder
within the home folder), thereby conserving disk space when the same
tools are used across multiple projects.

In order to allow the projects to access the binary tools installed in the
central store, instead of unpacking the archives in `xpacks`,
**xpm** adds symbolic links pointing to the **central xPacks store**.

The outcome is functionally equivalent to installing the tools into
each project, but without the wasted disk space.

:::tip

It is possible to force a local install into a project
by passing `--copy` to `xpm install`.

:::

If needed, it is also possible to install packages only globally, without
creating local <LinksVsForwarders isWindows={ props.isWindows }/> (see below).

</details>

<details>
<summary>The central xPacks cache</summary>

To save download time, all archives are first stored in a
cache, and all subsequent downloads are replaced with the
cached content.

Therefore all published archives should be read-only and
it is not allowed to replace them at a later time.

</details>

### Initialise the project

Upon initial use, ensure that a `package.json` file is present in the
project root folder.

This can be achieved by running `xpm init` in the desired project folder
(substitute `my-project` accordingly):

```sh
cd my-project
xpm init
```

### Install into the project

The next step is to install the
**openocd** package into the project:

<CodeBlock language="sh"> {
`xpm install @xpack-dev-tools/openocd@latest --verbose`
} </CodeBlock>

The main result is a set
of <LinksVsForwarders isWindows={ props.isWindows }/> in
the `.bin` folder:

<CodeBlock language="console"> {
`${ props.isWindows === 'True' ? 'dir xpacks\\.bin' : 'ls -l xpacks/.bin' }`
} </CodeBlock>

<details>
<summary>PATH setup</summary>

With all binary tools installed in `xpacks/.bin`, the project build
configurations need only a single PATH adjustment:

```sh
export PATH=<...project-path...>/xpacks/.bin:$PATH
```

{ props.isWindows === 'True' ?
  <Admonition type="tip">
    <p>This syntax is for the Git Bash console.
      When using COMMAND.EXE or Power Shell,
      adjust the syntax for the corresponding Windows specific shell.
    </p>
  </Admonition>
 : ''
}
</details>

<details>
<summary>Installation details</summary>

The above `xpm install` command will do the following:

* identify the platform specific archive for the latest available version
  of OpenOCD, download it into a cache and unpack
  it into a versioned folder
  in the **central xPacks store** (if not already there);
  check the output of the `xpm install` command for the actual
  folder used on your platform;
* create a local symbolic link
  like <code>xpacks/@xpack-dev-tools/openocd</code> pointing to the
  versioned folder in the central xPacks store
* add <LinksVsForwarders isWindows={ props.isWindows }/> into
  the local `xpacks/.bin` folder, referring to the binaries in
  <code>xpacks/@xpack-dev-tools/openocd/.content/bin</code>;
* add <code>@xpack-dev-tools/openocd</code> to
  `package.json` as a
  development dependency; this associates a specific version of OpenOCD with
  the current project (details below).

:::tip

The install location can be configured using the
`XPACKS_STORE_FOLDER` environment variable; for more details please check the
[xpm folders](https://xpack.github.io/xpm/folders/) page.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Reproducibility and `devDependencies`</summary>

To ensure reproducibility, it is essential for each project to always
use the exact desired versions of the required tools, regardless of the
tools installed in the system.

To achieve this goal, **xpm** records all locally installed binary packages
as development dependencies in the project `package.json` file.

The result looks like this:

<CodeBlock language="json"> {
`  "xpack": {
    "minimumXpmRequired": "0.19.1",
    "dependencies": {},
    "devDependencies": {
      "@xpack-dev-tools/openocd": {
        "specifier": "${ customField('upstreamVersion') }-${ customField('xpackSubversion') }.${ customField('npmSubversion') }",
        "local": "link",
        "platforms": "all"
      }
    },
    "properties": {},
    "actions": {},
    "buildConfigurations": {}
  }`
} </CodeBlock>

If the `package.json` is saved in the revision system, the above
definition acts as a hard reference to the specific version of
**xPack OpenOCD**.

After cloning the project into a different location, the command `xpm install`
can be used to install all development dependencies.

This is particularly useful for CI/CD environments.

</details>

### Install globally

For older development environments,
it is also possible to install OpenOCD only globally in
the **central xPacks store**, without any
local <LinksVsForwarders isWindows={ props.isWindows }/>; it
is the developer's responsibility to configure the path to the tools.

No other files are installed in any system folders or other locations.

<CodeBlock language="sh"> {
`xpm install @xpack-dev-tools/openocd@latest --global --verbose`
} </CodeBlock>

:::note

Installing packages locally into a project always installs the
packages in the **central xPacks store**; subsequent attempts to
install the packages globally will fail with _already installed_.
