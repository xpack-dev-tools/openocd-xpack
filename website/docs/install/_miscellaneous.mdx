## Drivers

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">

<TabItem value="windows" label="Windows" default>

As usual on Windows, mastering drivers is a challenge and OpenOCD is no
exceptions, so don't be surprised to encounter many incompatible drivers
for various JTAG probes.

<h3>Zadig</h3>

The OpenOCD distribution includes some libusb
drivers, and recommends to run the [`zadig.exe`](https://zadig.akeo.ie) tool to activate them.

For example
[ARM-USB-OCD](https://www.olimex.com/Products/ARM/JTAG/) from
[Olimex](https://www.olimex.com/), after installing the vendor drivers,
asks to install Zadig and convert the vendor drivers to WinUSB drivers.

:::caution

Although converting the vendor drivers
to WinUSB drivers will make OpenOCD happy, please be aware that other
tools using the original drivers will no longer work while Zadig is
active, and to make them work you need to uninstall the Zadig driver
for the device and reinstall the vendor driver (see
[Zadig FAQ](https://github.com/pbatard/libwdi/wiki/FAQ#Help_Zadig_replaced_the_driver_for_the_wrong_device_How_do_I_restore_it)).
Our
recommendation is to use Zadig only as a last resort solution, and, when
possible, prefer the manufacturer drivers.

<h3>ST-LINK</h3>

One example of compatible drivers are the ST-LINK USB drivers, from ST,
available as part number
[STSW-LINK009](https://www.st.com/web/en/catalog/tools/FM147/SC1887/PF260219).
Download the latest `stsw-link009.zip` archive, extract its content into a separate
folder, and run the `dpinst_amd64.exe` (or `dpinst_x86.exe`) with
administrative privileges.

As for most Windows drivers, to complete the installation, a restart
usually helps.

Connect the ST-LINK or the DISCOVERY board and check in **Control Panel**
→ **System** → **Device Manager** if the JTAG is operational.

For other probes follow the manufacturer instructions.

:::note

All Windows tests were performed on Windows 11.
If, for any
reasons, you still need to use older versions, especially the venerable Windows XP,
some differences may be observed in the USB subsystem; to stay on the
safe side, try to always use original manufacturer drivers.

<TabItem value="macos" label="macOS">

On macOS, JTAG probes implemented as USB devices usually are
recognised directly and do not need explicit drivers.

<TabItem value="linux" label="GNU/Linux">

<h3>UDEV</h3>

For the JTAG probes implemented as USB devices (actually most of them),
the last installation step on GNU/Linux is to configure the **UDEV**
subsystem. OpenOCD provides an UDEV rules file defining all the
supported IDs; to install it, just copy the file to `/etc/udev/rules.d`
and eventually notify the daemon:

<CodeBlock language="sh"> {
`sudo cp ~/.local/xPacks/@xpack-dev-tools/openocd/${ customField('upstreamVersion') }-${ customField('xpackSubversion') }.${ customField('npmSubversion') }/.content/contrib/60-openocd.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
`} </CodeBlock>

To make the change effective, reload the rules:

```sh
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
```

:::tip

If you previously installed the
J-Link binaries, the USB IDs were
already added to UDEV. The above OpenOCD rules file also defines the
J-Link ID. Apparently UDEV does not complain; if you encounter
problems, just comment out the definition in the OpenOCD file.

:::

<h3>USB access rights</h3>

On some GNU/Linux distributions, the UDEV definitions are not enough,
or are not effective, and when trying to access the JTAG probe,
an error is issued:

```console
libusb_open failed: LIBUSB_ERROR_ACCESS
```

If this happens, first try to start openocd with `sudo`; if this works,
for regular work you also need to grant your user permission to use the USB.

For example, on Ubuntu you need to issue something like:

```sh
sudo usermod -aG plugdev $USER
```

Then restart and login again.

If you still have problems, check your distribution documentation and
when you have a functional solution post it on the project
[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/openocd-xpack/discussions/).
