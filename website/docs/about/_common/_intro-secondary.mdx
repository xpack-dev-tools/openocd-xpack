This project currently functions as a supplementary tool for building
the primary xPack Development Tools. Since these tools are exclusively
built on macOS and GNU/Linux, to reduce maintenance efforts, for now
there are no Windows binaries. However, the project is versatile and can be
used in any builds; if necessary, Windows binaries can be added in future
releases.
