### Check the latest upstream release

The current upstream release is expected to
be announced in the [OpenOCD](https://openocd.org)
web, and reflected in the Git
[tags](https://sourceforge.net/p/openocd/code/ci/master/tree/).
Compare the latest tag with the current xPack
[release](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/openocd-xpack/releases).
If necessary, update the triplet, otherwise increase the fourth number,
as below.
