### Check the latest upstream release

The latest upstream releases must have been announced in
the [OpenOCD](https://openocd.org) web, and reflected in
the [Git tags](https://sourceforge.net/p/openocd/code/ci/master/tree/).

Compare the latest upstream release with the latest xPack
[release](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/openocd-xpack/releases/).
If necessary, update the triplet, otherwise increase the fourth number,
as below.
