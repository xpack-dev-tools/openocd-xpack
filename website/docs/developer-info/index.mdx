This page is intended for those who want to build the
**xPack OpenOCD**
binaries themselves.

:::note

The content of this page is still work in progress and will be updated shortly.

<details>
<summary>The xPack Build Box</summary>

The build scripts in this project use the **xPack Build Box** (**XBB**)
tools, which require the usual native development tools
(packed as a Docker image for GNU/Linux builds), complemented with
several binary xPacks, installed with `xpm` as development dependencies.

For those interested in understanding how things work, a good starting point
would be to read the [XBB](https://xpack.github.io/xbb/) page.

:::caution

The XBB tools are intended for building standalone relocatable distributions,
thus are quite complex and perform several post-processing steps to
adjust RPATH and validate the resulting binaries.

For the traditional `configure && make install` builds specific to Linux,
these scripts are probably too complicated and therefore are not recommended
for inexperienced users.

<details>
<summary>xPack build configurations</summary>

The xPack framework supports projects with **multiple build configurations**.

Build configurations are sets of **properties**, **actions** and **dependencies**
that apply to a specific build. Build configurations can inherit from
other build configurations.

For simple projects, the typical use case is with two configurations,
**Debug** and **Release**.

For building the xPack binary tools, there is one configuration
for each platform:

- `darwin-x64`
- `darwin-arm64`
- `linux-x64`
- `win32-x64`
- `linux-arm64`
- `linux-arm`

:::note

In case you wonder where these names come
from, they are exactly the Node.js `process.platform` and `process.arch`
for each platform.

:::

The build configurations are defined in the `package.json` file, in the
`xpack` section.


```json
{
  "...":"...",
  "xpack": {
    "buildConfigurations": {
       "...": {
       },
      "win32-x64": {
        "inherit": [
          "common-dependencies",
          "common-actions",
          "common-docker"
        ],
        "devDependencies": {
          "@xpack-dev-tools/gcc": "13.2.0-2.1",
          "@xpack-dev-tools/mingw-w64-gcc": "13.2.0-1.1",
          "@xpack-dev-tools/wine": "8.0.2-1.1"
        },
        "properties": {
          "dockerImage": "ilegeul/ubuntu:amd64-18.04-xbb-v5.1.1"
        },
        "actions": {
          "build": "{{ properties.commandBashBuild }} --windows",
          "build-development": "{{ properties.commandBashBuild }} --windows --development",
          "build-development-debug": "{{ properties.commandBashBuild }} --windows --development --debug",
          "build-development-tests-only": "{{ properties.commandBashBuild }} --windows --development --tests-only"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```


To ask **xpm** to perform a specific action on a given build configuration,
use the `--config <name>` option.

For example:

```sh
xpm install --config darwin-x64
xpm run build --config darwin-x64
```

<details>
<summary>xPack actions</summary>

The xPack actions are extensions of npm scripts, i.e. named sequences
of commands that are invoked via `xpm run <name>` to perform specific
operations.
together in a sub-shell .

The commands are invoked in a sub-shell with an adjusted PATH,
having the `xpacks/.bin`
folder prepended. This ensures the locally installed tools are
prefered to the system tools.

Actions can be defined for the entire project or for a specific build
configuration.

The actions are defined in the `package.json` file, in the
`xpack` section, at the top or inside build configurations.

:::tip

For those who, for various reasons, can not use **xpm**, it is
perfectly possible to manually adjust the PATH and to invoke the
sequence of commands in order, just that it is more tedious,
since multiple substitutions must be performed to compose the
commands.

<details>
<summary>Visual Studio Code integration</summary>

xPack actions and build configurations are supported in Visual Studio via the
[xPack C/C++ Managed Build Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ilg-vscode.xpack) extension.

With this extension installed, xPack actions can be very conveniently
invoked via a single mouse click, for example:

![xPack actions](https://github.com/xpack/vscode-xpack-extension-ts/raw/master/assets/docs-images/xpack-actions.png)

</details>

## Prerequisites

The build scripts run on GNU/Linux and macOS. The Windows binaries are
generated on x64 GNU/Linux, using [mingw-w64](https://mingw-w64.org).

For details on installing the prerequisites, please read the
[XBB prerequisites page](https://xpack.github.io/xbb/prerequisites/).

## Get project sources

The project is hosted on GitHub:

- https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/openocd-xpack.git

<details>
<summary>Branches</summary>

Apart from the unused `master` branch, there are two active branches:

- `xpack`, with the latest stable version (default)
- <code>xpack-development</code>, with the current development version

All development is done in the <code>xpack-development</code> branch, and contributions via
Pull Requests should be directed to this branch.

When new releases are published, the <code>xpack-development</code> branch is merged
into `xpack`.

</details>

To clone the stable branch (`xpack`), run the following commands in a
terminal (on Windows use the _Git Bash_ console):

```sh
rm -rf ~/Work/xpack-dev-tools/openocd-xpack.git && \
git clone https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/openocd-xpack.git \
  ~/Work/xpack-dev-tools/openocd-xpack.git
```

<details>
<summary>For development purposes, clone the <code>xpack-development</code> branch.</summary>

```sh
rm -rf ~/Work/xpack-dev-tools/openocd-xpack.git && \
mkdir -p ~/Work/xpack-dev-tools && \
git clone \
  --branch xpack-development \
  https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/openocd-xpack.git \
  ~/Work/xpack-dev-tools/openocd-xpack.git
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Get the helper sources (optional, for development purposes)</summary>

The project has a dependency to a common **helper**, that is
normally installed as a read-only dependency; **for development
purposes**, to be able to make changes to the scripts located in the helper,
clone the <code>xpack-development</code> branch and link it to the central
xPacks store:

```sh
rm -rf ~/Work/xpack-dev-tools/xbb-helper-xpack.git && \
mkdir -p ~/Work/xpack-dev-tools && \
git clone \
  --branch xpack-development \
  https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/xbb-helper-xpack.git \
  ~/Work/xpack-dev-tools/xbb-helper-xpack.git && \
xpm link -C ~/Work/xpack-dev-tools/xbb-helper-xpack.git
```

For more details the how a writable helper can be used via
`xpm link`, please see the
[XBB](https://xpack.github.io/xbb/#writable-helper-scripts) documentation.

## How to build

The builds require dedicated machines for each platform
(x64 GNU/Linux, armh64 GNU/Linux, arm GNU/Linux,
x64 macOS and arm64 macOS).

### Update the repo

```sh
git -C ~/Work/xpack-dev-tools/openocd-xpack.git pull
```

<details>
<summary>... and the helper (when using a writable helper) ...</summary>

```sh
git -C ~/Work/xpack-dev-tools/xbb-helper-xpack.git pull
```

</details>

### macOS builds

<PlatformNativeSection platform="darwin-x64"/>

<PlatformNativeSection platform="darwin-arm64"/>

### GNU/Linux & Windows builds

<PlatformDockerSection platform="linux-x64"/>

<PlatformDockerSection platform="win32-x64"/>

<PlatformDockerSection platform="linux-arm64"/>

<PlatformDockerSection platform="linux-arm"/>

### Debug builds

In some cases it is necessary to run a debug session with the binaries.

For these cases, the build script accepts the `--debug` options.

There are also xPack actions that use this option (`build-development-debug`
and `docker-build-development-debug`).

### Files cache

The XBB build scripts use a local cache such that files are downloaded only
during the first run, later runs being able to use the cached files.

However, occasionally some servers may not be available, and the builds
may fail.

The workaround is to manually download the files from alternate
locations (like
https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/files-cache/tree/master/libs),
place them in the XBB cache (`Work/cache`) and restart the build.
