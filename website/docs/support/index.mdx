# How to get help for xPack OpenOCD

## Quick links

The quick answer is to use the
[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/openocd-xpack/discussions/) pages.

## Check documentation

As usual, before anything, it is a good idea to check the project
documentation.

<Documentation/>

## Preliminary checks

Before posting any questions or providing feedback,
check if the subject was not already addressed.

- check the [FAQ](/docs/faq/)
for similar problems
- check the [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/openocd-xpack/discussions/) for
similar topics
- check the
[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/openocd-xpack/issues/)
tracker for similar problems.

## Ask questions in GitHub Discussions

If you still could not find a solution, if you have interesting use
cases, if you have custom configurations, and generally if you have
any experience that you want to share with others, use the
[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/openocd-xpack/discussions/) pages,
and enter a **New discussion**; use the **Q&A** category for questions, **Ideas** for suggestions and **General** for anything else.

## Register a new support ticket only if necessary

If you are convinced that you identified a bug related to the xPack binary
distribution, not to the upstream OpenOCD itself
(if you have doubts, use the GitHub Discussions),
or if you have a pertinent suggestion how to enhance the **xPack OpenOCD**
distribution, register a **New Issue** in the
[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/openocd-xpack/issues/)
tracker.

:::tip

**Do not** use the GitHub Issues tracker
for questions and support, **use the
[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/openocd-xpack/discussions/)** pages.

## Use of private e-mail

:::caution Please, please, please!

**Do not** use
private e-mail for support, **use the
[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/openocd-xpack/discussions/)** pages.

:::

Sending private messages will be automatically replied with
a short message including a link to this page.
The reason for this rude behaviour is simply an attempt to use
the time more efficiently; since discussions are archived, other people
having similar problems might benefit from the answers.
