### Disclaimer

The xPack OpenOCD is only a binary distribution of the standard source code
OpenOCD, and does not intend to add new functionality, or to fix existing
problems.

If you have questions/suggestions related to the procedure used to
build/publish the binary distribution, continue reading the next sections.

If you have problems related to OpenOCD functionality, please use the
official [OpenOCD support channels](http://openocd.org/discussion/).

### Prerequisites

Before entering a new ticket, please consider the following:

- [ ] check the [xPack Forums](https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/xpack/) for similar problems
- [ ] check the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/openocd-xpack/issues/)

If you still could not find a solution, if you have interesting use

any experience that you want to share with others, use the
[xPack Forums](https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/xpack/), the OpenOCD section.

If you are convinced that you identified a bug related to the binary
